# Snapback / Reclaim

> **Kabroda Trading BattleBox — Strategy Doctrine**

The **Snapback / Reclaim** strategy exists to handle **failed breakouts and failed acceptance**. It allows Kabroda to respond *after* the market has shown deception, rather than forcing continuation where it does not exist.

This strategy is reactive, defensive, and precise. It is not a prediction tool.

---

## 1. Why This Strategy Exists

Markets do not always continue after breaking a trigger.

Sometimes:
- Price breaks out
- Acceptance fails
- Support does not hold
- The market snaps back into balance

The Core Trigger Pullback cannot operate here because **direction was never earned**.

The Snapback / Reclaim strategy exists to:
- Respond to **failed acceptance**
- Capitalize on **trapped participants**
- Trade price **back toward fair value**

Kabroda interpretation:
> “The breakout failed. Now the market must unwind the mistake.”

---

## 2. What Must Fail First

This strategy is **never proactive**.

Before Snapback / Reclaim is considered, the following must occur:
- A breakout or breakdown attempt
- Failure to hold the flipped level
- Price returns back through the trigger

Key principle:
- The market attempted discovery
- Discovery was **rejected**

Kabroda interpretation:
> “The market tried to leave balance. It was not allowed.”

---

## 3. What a True Reclaim Looks Like

A true reclaim is not speed — it is **behavioral change**.

Observed reclaim behavior:
- Price moves back inside the prior range
- The former breakout level becomes **resistance** again
- Price slows and fails to re-expand
- Attempts to push back through are rejected

Kabroda interpretation:
> “What was supposed to hold did not.”

This confirms that the breakout participants are trapped.

---

## 4. Trade Objective — Return to Fair Value

Snapback / Reclaim is a **mean-return strategy**.

Typical objectives:
- Return to the middle of the range
- Return to point of control
- In some cases, travel toward the opposite trigger

This strategy does **not** assume full reversal.

Kabroda interpretation:
> “This move corrects imbalance — it does not start a new trend.”

Positions are managed with that expectation.

---

## 5. Why This Strategy Is More Aggressive

Snapback / Reclaim trades:
- Occur after failure
- Move quickly
- Are shorter duration

Because of this:
- Risk must be controlled tightly
- The 5-minute 21 EMA is critical
- Overstaying is punished

Kabroda interpretation:
> “Take what the market gives. Don’t demand more.”

---

## 6. Common Trader Mistakes

Traders fail this strategy by:
- Treating it as a trend reversal
- Holding too long
- Expecting continuation beyond balance
- Entering before reclaim is proven

Another frequent error:
- Fading strong higher-timeframe trends

Kabroda warning:
> “If higher timeframes are in control, snapbacks are shallow or fail.”

---

## 7. When This Strategy Is NOT Allowed

Kabroda disallows Snapback / Reclaim when:
- Higher timeframes are strongly aligned
- Acceptance is clean and holding
- Expansion shows follow-through
- The market is trending with conviction

In these cases:
- Failed pullbacks are noise
- Fighting trend is forbidden

Kabroda interpretation:
> “Do not stand in front of a moving market.”

---

## 8. Kabroda Voice Before Confirmation

When a snapback is **possible but unconfirmed**, Kabroda may say:
- “Acceptance is failing — watching.”
- “Breakout not holding.”
- “Potential reclaim developing.”

Kabroda must **never** say:
- “This is reversing.”
- “Trend change confirmed.”
- “Hold for continuation.”

Kabroda does not promise reversals.
Kabroda observes failure.

---

## 9. Philosophy of Execution

Snapback / Reclaim trades are:
- Tactical
- Time-sensitive
- Not conviction trades

They are designed to:
- Exploit failed attempts
- Reset market positioning

Kabroda interpretation:
> “This trade ends where balance begins.”

---

## 10. Summary — Kabroda Doctrine

- This strategy exists because breakouts fail
- Failure must be proven, not assumed
- The goal is return to fair value
- Overstaying is dangerous
- Discipline matters more than conviction

Kabroda does not fight the market.
Kabroda responds when the market lies.
