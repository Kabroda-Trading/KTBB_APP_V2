# Kabroda Trading BattleBox — Master System Index

> **Purpose:** This index is the authoritative map of the entire KTBB doctrine stack. It defines how each document, concept, and rule connects so the system stays coherent, expandable, and non-contradictory over time.

Kabroda is not a collection of strategies.
Kabroda is an **operating system**.

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

Kabroda operates on three integrated brains, supported by an operational layer.

### Brain 1 — Market Structure (Environment)
Answers:
- *Where are we?*
- *What phase is the market in?*

### Brain 2 — Strategy Doctrine (Permission)
Answers:
- *What is allowed here?*
- *What is forbidden?*

### Brain 3 — Psychology Doctrine (Behavior)
Answers:
- *How should the trader behave right now?*

### Operational Layer
Answers:
- *How does this become a daily workflow?*

---

## 2. Brain 1 — Market Structure Doctrine

These documents define **market state**. They never give entries or targets.

### Core Structure Files
- **Balance vs Discovery**  
  → Defines fair value vs directional auction

- **Compression vs Expansion**  
  → Defines energy buildup and release

- **Acceptance vs Rejection**  
  → Defines truth vs failure at key levels

### Dependency Rules
- Structure is evaluated **top-down** (HTF → LTF)
- Structure always overrides strategy
- No strategy is valid without a structure call

Kabroda rule:
> “If structure is unclear, execution is forbidden.”

---

## 3. Brain 2 — Strategy Doctrine

Strategies define **how Kabroda participates**, never when to force action.

### Strategy Set

1. **Core Trigger Pullback**  
   *Role:* Trend participation after acceptance  
   *Requires:* Discovery + acceptance  
   *Forbids:* Chasing expansion

2. **Snapback / Reclaim**  
   *Role:* Failure response  
   *Requires:* Failed acceptance  
   *Objective:* Return to balance

3. **Range → Trigger Transition**  
   *Role:* Preparation during balance  
   *Requires:* Range conditions  
   *Forbids:* Directional bias

### Strategy Hierarchy

- Only **one strategy** may be active at a time
- Strategies never overlap
- Strategy changes only after structure changes

Kabroda rule:
> “Permission precedes execution.”

---

## 4. Brain 3 — Psychology Doctrine

Psychology doctrine protects **timing, discipline, and consistency**.

### Psychological Axes

- Fear ↔ Patience
- FOMO ↔ Confirmation
- Boredom ↔ Discipline

### Core Psychological Laws

- Emotions are signals, not commands
- Waiting is a skill
- Missing trades is acceptable
- No-trade days are winning days

### Enforcement Rules

- Emotional spikes = pause
- Rule violations = stand down
- Losses reviewed by structure, not PnL

Kabroda rule:
> “Protect the trader first. Capital follows.”

---

## 5. Operational Layer — Daily Workflow

### Daily Market Review (DMR)

Files:
- **DMR Philosophy**  
- **DMR Hybrid Template**

Purpose:
- Orient the trader
- Define regime
- Grant or deny strategy permission
- Set behavioral posture

DMR Order of Operations:
1. HTF environment
2. Market regime
3. Strategy permission
4. Key levels (orientation only)
5. Behavioral guidance

Kabroda rule:
> “The DMR prepares. The market decides.”

---

## 6. Execution Layer (Guardrails)

Execution rules are **fixed** and never reinterpreted.

### Core Execution Laws

- Direction only after **15M two-close acceptance**
- Entries filtered on **5M structure alignment**
- **5M 21 EMA = hard exit** (no exceptions)
- No chasing extended moves
- No counter-trend trades at HTF levels

Kabroda rule:
> “Rules protect capital, not opportunity.”

---

## 7. Information Flow Diagram (Conceptual)

HTF Structure  
↓  
Market Regime  
↓  
Strategy Permission  
↓  
Psychological Posture  
↓  
Execution (If Allowed)

If any layer fails → execution halts.

---

## 8. Expansion & Versioning Rules

Kabroda is designed to evolve.

Allowed expansions:
- New strategies (must map to regime)
- Additional psychology modules
- Asset-specific overlays

Forbidden changes:
- Altering execution rules casually
- Mixing strategies
- Adding prediction language

Versioning principle:
- Doctrine changes are additive, not destructive

---

## 9. Final System Law

Kabroda does not predict.
Kabroda does not rush.
Kabroda does not chase.

Kabroda observes structure.
Kabroda grants permission.
Kabroda protects behavior.

**Consistency is the edge.**
